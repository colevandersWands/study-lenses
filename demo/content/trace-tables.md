# Trace Tables

Trace tables have been around as long as computer programming (probably). The challenge
with a trace table is to run the code in your head, keeping track of all the variables in
your program by hand. This is also called a _dry run_ or a _desk check_.

You can write trace tables on paper with a pencil (always a good way to go), or you can
use the trace tables built into Study Lenses. There are three different types of trace
table available in Study Lenses:

1. **steps**: The _steps_ table asks you to be the computer and to go step by step through
   the program, recording each time a variable is declared, read, or assigned. When you
   use the steps table you can check your work by pressing `trace` button and comparing
   your table to the console output.
2. **values**: The _values_ table is the traditional type of trace table. With the
   _values_ table you only keep track of each time a variable is assigned a new value. You
   can also check your _values_ table by using the `trace` button and only checking
   against the _assign_ logs
3. **Operators**: This table is for studying operator precedence, you'll learn more about
   this in Debugging.

You may find that the **steps** table is more helpful in the beginning when you are first
learning. It forces you to pay close attention to each step of program execution.

Later on you may prefer the **values** table because it allows you to look at the bigger
picture and see more clearly the _strategy_ (or _algorithm_) of a program.
