# Numbers

A primitive type used to represent numbers. The programs in this module used mostly
strings, but there will be few numbers.

Numbers in JavaScript are challenging to work with and understand, even for experienced
developers. You will take a deeper look into numbers in the next module - Debugging. For
now you just need to know this:

```js
'use strict';
console.log('-- numbers --');

console.log(1.5);
console.log(1);
console.log(0);
console.log(-1);
console.log(-1.5);
```
